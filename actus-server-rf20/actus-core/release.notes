Branch rf2dev
--------------
This version of actus-core: (1) is built and tested with Java version jdk17 and built
with maven 3.6.3; (2) it is modified to support an External Risk Service via the RiskFactorAPI 2.0
implmented in the corresponding rf2dev branched of actus-webapp and actus-risk-service.  It was 
developed by Francis Parr in Sep 2024

The start point for the creating this branch was branch V101jdk17. Since there are updates in 
V102jdk17 ( also based ) with bugs fixed merging with this version may be desirable before release
